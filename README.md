The "Digital Clock" is a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that functions as a versatile timekeeping tool. It provides users with the ability to view the current time in different time zones, as well as features for implementing a stopwatch and timer functionality. This brief explanation outlines the main aspects of the Digital Clock application:

**Features:**
- **Watch Mode:** Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds, allowing users to keep track of the current time in different time zones.
- **Stopwatch Mode:** Provides a basic stopwatch functionality that records elapsed time when started and displays it in the format of hours, minutes, and seconds. Users can use this mode to measure durations for various activities.
- **Timer Mode:** Placeholder for implementing a timer functionality, enabling users to set countdown timers for different purposes. This mode is intended to allow users to set specific time intervals and initiate countdowns.
- **Time Zone Switching:** Allows users to cycle through a predefined list of time zones, helping them observe time differences across various regions.

**Usage:**
1. Launch the application.
2. The main window displays the current time based on the default time zone (GMT) and offers buttons for selecting different functionalities.
3. The "Watch" button displays the current time in the selected time zone.
4. The "Stopwatch" button starts a stopwatch, which counts up from the moment the button is clicked. It provides a simple way to measure elapsed time.
5. The "Timer" button is a placeholder for implementing countdown timer functionality.
6. The "Switch Time Zone" button cycles through different time zones, updating the displayed time accordingly.

**Setup and Execution:**
1. Ensure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the provided code using a Java compiler (e.g., `javac DigitalClock.java`).
3. Run the compiled program (e.g., `java DigitalClock`).
4. The graphical user interface (GUI) window will appear, showing the current time in the default time zone.

**Note:**
- This explanation provides a high-level overview of the application's features and usage.
- The Stopwatch and Timer modes are placeholders and require further implementation to achieve their full functionality.
- The application's user interface and behavior can be customized and enhanced as needed.

In summary, the "Digital Clock" application in Java offers users a convenient way to keep track of time in different time zones, utilize a basic stopwatch, and eventually implement countdown timers. It showcases the versatility and potential of Java GUI programming in creating functional and user-friendly applications.
